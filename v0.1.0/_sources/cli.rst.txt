Command line interface

In general, the only command that downstream repos will ever need to run is

.. code-block:: bash

    generate-bones

from the root directory containing ``.nengobones.yml``.  This updates all of
the templated files that need to be manually updated and committed to the
downstream repository.  Note that there are other files that
``generate-bones`` can generate, but this is done automatically
(i.e., dynamically) by ``nengo-bones`` during continuous integration.

However, it may be helpful when debugging a ``.nengobones.yml`` configuration
to be able to see the rendered output, so we expose all the ``nengo-bones``
functionality through different command line options, which can be found
below.

.. click:: nengo_bones.scripts.generate_bones:main
    :prog: generate-bones
    :show-nested:

.. click:: nengo_bones.scripts.check_bones:main
    :prog: check-bones
    :show-nested:
