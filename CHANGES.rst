22.11.15 (November 15, 2022)
============================

**Added**

- Added support for new ``one_page`` option in ``nengo-sphinx-theme``. (`#101`_)
- Added the ``bones-format-notebook`` script to apply automated formatting, cleanup,
  and static checking to Jupyter notebooks. (`#32`_)
- Static script will now check that ``bones-format-notebook`` has been applied to all
  notebooks in the ``docs`` directory. (`#32`_)
- Added ``remote-script.sh`` CI script for running other CI scripts on a remote device.
  (`#124`_)
- Added `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ configuration to
  ``pyproject.toml`` and check import order during static checks. (`#121`_)
- Officially support and test against Python 3.9. (`#136`_)
- Added ``skip`` option to codespell config, which can be used to specify files that
  should be ignored. (`#138`_)
- Added support for projects with type hints through the ``py_typed`` section. (`#140`_)
- Added ``min_python`` option to the main section. The default ``python_requires``
  in ``setup.py`` is now based on this, if not overridden. (`#140`_)
- Added support for changing the main branch name with the ``main_branch``
  config option. (`#145`_)
- Added template for ``version.py``. (`#151`_)
- Added ``apache`` license type. (`#160`_)
- Added ``proprietary`` license type. (`#162`_)
- Added several actions for use with Github Actions:
  ``setup`` initializes  a python environment,
  ``generate-and-check`` runs ``bones-generate`` and ``bones-check``,
  ``run-script`` runs a CI script such as ``static.sh``, and
  ``coverage-report`` generates combined coverage reports. (`#166`_)
- Added support for ``docformatter`` (and static checks will now enforce that
  docformatter has been applied). (`#168`_)
- Added support for building and releasing Python projects through the
  ``deploy`` CI script. (`#172`_)
- Added a ``bones check-deploy`` script that checks several items that we
  depend on for releases. (`#172`_)

**Changed**

- Restrict pylint version to <2.5 due to issue when the package being checked
  is not installed in the current environment. (`#103`_)
- Increased minimum ``pylint`` version to 2.5.1 (`#32`_)
- Documentation ``[source]`` links now point to GitHub. (`#117`_)
- Separate tokens, ``PYPI_TOKEN`` and ``PYPI_TEST_TOKEN``, must now be specified
  for deploying to PyPI and TestPyPI, respectively. (`#127`_)
- Builds for this repository now run on TravisCI.com instead of TravisCI.org. (`#130`_)
- Drop support for Python 3.5. (`#123`_)
- Doc script will now install Sphinx>=3.1.2. (`#137`_)
- Codespell ignore words is now specified via the ``codespell.ignore_words`` section
  of ``setup_cfg`` (instead of in the static CI script config). As a result, it will
  now apply to all invocations of codespell (not just from the static script). (`#138`_)
- ``bones-format-notebook --check`` will now require that all ``codespell`` checks pass.
  (`#138`_)
- Switched to new version of Codecov uploader and added checksum verification. (`#150`_)
- Increased minimum ``black`` version to 21.12b0. (`#104`_, `#159`_)
- License fields in ``setup.py`` are now set using ``license_rst.type``. (`#161`_)
- Trove classifiers in ``setup.py`` are now sorted alphabetically. (`#161`_)
- Updated Nengo license and renamed to ABR license. (`#157`_)
- The license type is now specified through a ``license`` key at the top level.
  If not specified, it defaults to ``proprietary``. (`#157`_)
- All CI scripts now support running either through Github Actions or TravisCI.
  (`#166`_)
- Added additional config options to mypy ``setup.cfg`` template. (`#170`_)
- Restrict setuptools version to <64 (fixes issues with various code inspection tools
  like mypy, pylint, IDE integrations). (`#173`_)
- Removed the ``deploy_dists`` configuration option for the ``deploy`` script,
  and replaced it with a boolean ``wheel`` option. (`#172`_)
- Consolidated all scripts under a single ``bones`` command. Subcommands have the
  same names as before, without the ``bones-`` prefix (e.g., ``bones-generate``
  is now ``bones generate``). (`#172`_)

**Removed**

- Removed ``before_script``, ``before_cache``, ``before_deploy``, and ``after_deploy``
  steps from CI scripts (they weren't actually used anywhere). (`#166`_)
- Removed ``analytics_id`` option for ``docs/conf.py``. Create a custom ``docs/conf.py``
  template and override the ``analytics`` block if you need to customize analytics
  tracking. (`#169`_)
- Removed support for TravisCI in CI scripts. All downstream repositories should
  switch to use Github Actions. (`#172`_)

**Fixed**

- Intermittent failures installing miniconda in the remote script have been fixed by
  retrying the miniconda install if it fails. (`#130`_)
- Fixed an issue in which Codecov would not report on files where a file in a
  deeper folder shares the same name. (`#132`_)
- Fixed an issue in which CI scripts did not have access to the same configuration
  options as other templates. (`#144`_)
- Removed pylint disable for ``bad-continuation`` as it no longer exists. (`#163`_)
- Removed pylint disable for ``no-self-use`` as it is now optional. (`#163`_)
- Static checks will not try to check ``docs`` directory if it doesn't exist. (`#165`_)
- Static checks will no longer assume that CI scripts are in a folder named ``.ci``
  (it will look for any scripts in the same folder as the static script). (`#166`_)
- Black will now ignore excluded files even if that filename is passed directly
  to black (e.g. when running through a precommit hook or IDE plugin). (`#161`_)
- Only delete remote build directories more than a day old. (`#172`_)

  latest release), to streamline the process of distributing changes to those core
  repos. (`#97`_)

.. _#97: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/97

0.10.0 (March 19, 2020)

  options to the ``pytest`` section of the ``setup.cfg`` template to
  support testing changes in Nengo 3.0. (`#58`_)

**Changed**

- The default value for ``pytest.addopts`` in ``setup.cfg`` has been removed
  because Nengo 3.0 does not require ``-p nengo.tests.options``. (`#58`_)

.. _#52: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/52

0.4.1 (July 26, 2019)

0.3.0 (July 19, 2019)
=====================

**Added**

- The ``nengo_bones.templates`` module was added to consolidate code
  that loads and renders templates. (`#45`_)

**Changed**

- The ``docs/conf.py`` template has been updated for new versions of
  Nengo Sphinx Theme. (`#46`_)
- ``static.sh`` and ``examples.sh`` will now check any notebooks in the
  ``docs`` folder (not just ``docs/examples``). (`#46`_)
- ``bones-check`` now checks that the content of the generated files
  matches the expected content, rather than relying on version numbers.
  This means most files will not need to be regenerated when new NengoBones
  versions are released, and that ``bones-check`` will be sensitive to changes
  within a dev version. (`#45`_)

**Fixed**

- The ``static.sh``/``examples.sh`` script will no longer fail if there are no
  notebooks in the ``docs`` folder. (`#46`_)

.. _#45: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/45

**Fixed**

- Fixed an issue with ``static.sh.template`` in which Python files
  that were not converted from notebooks were deleted. (`#16`_)

.. _#36: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/36

0.2.0 (May 15, 2019)
====================

**Added**

- Added ``apt_install`` option that can be set in the ``jobs`` section to
  ``apt install`` any custom ``apt`` requirements for a job. (`#14`_)
- Added templates for ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``, ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst``,
  ``LICENSE.rst``, ``MANIFEST.in``, ``docs/conf.py``, ``setup.cfg``, and
  ``setup.py`` (`#17`_)
- Templates will now be automatically loaded from a ``<repo>/.templates``
  directory if it exists. When overriding existing templates, the built-in
  templates can be accessed in ``include`` and ``extend`` tags with the
  ``templates/`` prefix. (`#17`_)
- Added ``flake8`` to the static check script. (`#17`_)
- Added the ``bones-pr-number`` script to predict the next PR number for a
  repository. This helps when writing a changelog entry before a PR has been
  made. (`#18`_)

**Changed**

- The Python version is now specified by the ``python`` option (instead of
  ``python_version``), for consistency with ``.travis.yml``. (`#14`_)
- All ``nengo-bones`` scripts now start with ``bones-``, to make them easier
  to find with autocompletion. ``generate-bones`` is now ``bones-generate``,
  and ``check-bones`` is now ``bones-check``. (`#18`_)

**Removed**

- Removed ``conda`` from the CI setup; all installations should be done
  through ``pip`` instead. (`#14`_)
- Removed the ``--template-dir`` option from the ``generate-bones`` script;
  use a ``.templates`` directory instead. (`#17`_)

**Fixed**

- Order of templated dicts should now be deterministic for
  all Python versions. (`#14`_)
