.. _#65: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/65

  options to the ``pytest`` section of the ``setup.cfg`` template to
  support testing changes in Nengo 3.0. (`#58`_)

**Changed**

- The default value for ``pytest.addopts`` in ``setup.cfg`` has been removed
  because Nengo 3.0 does not require ``-p nengo.tests.options``. (`#58`_)

0.4.2 (August 8, 2019)

.. _#52: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/52

=====================

**Added**

  in the ``static.sh`` script. (`#49`_)
- Templates will now be autoformatted with Black during the rendering
  process, if Black is installed. (`#49`_)

0.3.0 (July 19, 2019)
=====================

**Added**

- The ``nengo_bones.templates`` module was added to consolidate code
  that loads and renders templates. (`#45`_)

**Changed**

- The ``docs/conf.py`` template has been updated for new versions of
  Nengo Sphinx Theme. (`#46`_)
- ``static.sh`` and ``examples.sh`` will now check any notebooks in the
  ``docs`` folder (not just ``docs/examples``). (`#46`_)
- ``bones-check`` now checks that the content of the generated files
  matches the expected content, rather than relying on version numbers.
  This means most files will not need to be regenerated when new Nengo Bones
  versions are released, and that ``bones-check`` will be sensitive to changes
  within a dev version. (`#45`_)

**Fixed**

- The ``static.sh``/``examples.sh`` script will no longer fail if there are no
  notebooks in the ``docs`` folder. (`#46`_)

  which is a list of words that ``codespell`` will ignore. (`#35`_)

  which will enable Google Analytics tracking. (`#35`_)

**Fixed**

- Fixed an issue with ``static.sh.template`` in which Python files
  that were not converted from notebooks were deleted. (`#16`_)

0.2.0 (May 15, 2019)
====================

**Added**

- Added ``apt_install`` option that can be set in the ``jobs`` section to
  ``apt install`` any custom ``apt`` requirements for a job. (`#14`_)
- Added templates for ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``, ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst``,
  ``LICENSE.rst``, ``MANIFEST.in``, ``docs/conf.py``, ``setup.cfg``, and
  ``setup.py`` (`#17`_)
- Templates will now be automatically loaded from a ``<repo>/.templates``
  directory if it exists. When overriding existing templates, the built-in
  templates can be accessed in ``include`` and ``extend`` tags with the
  ``templates/`` prefix. (`#17`_)
- Added ``flake8`` to the static check script. (`#17`_)
- Added the ``bones-pr-number`` script to predict the next PR number for a
  repository. This helps when writing a changelog entry before a PR has been
  made. (`#18`_)

**Changed**

- The Python version is now specified by the ``python`` option (instead of
  ``python_version``), for consistency with ``.travis.yml``. (`#14`_)
- All ``nengo-bones`` scripts now start with ``bones-``, to make them easier
  to find with autocompletion. ``generate-bones`` is now ``bones-generate``,
  and ``check-bones`` is now ``bones-check``. (`#18`_)

**Removed**

- Removed ``conda`` from the CI setup; all installations should be done
  through ``pip`` instead. (`#14`_)
- Removed the ``--template-dir`` option from the ``generate-bones`` script;
  use a ``.templates`` directory instead. (`#17`_)

**Fixed**

- Order of templated dicts should now be deterministic for
  all Python versions. (`#14`_)
